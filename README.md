# BillDueDate

BillDueDate.com is a website to track when bill payments are due and when you will be low on cash.  BillDueDate will have the ability to sync with family members, send notifications and set re-occuring bill payments.

BillDueDate is a personal development project to learn more about web programming along with satisfying a manual process I use on a Google Sheet.
